# Week 1 Reflection
## Question 1
**When computer science meets economics**: Who do you truly want to become? Pick one of your favorite Nobel Prize winners (https://www.nobelprize.org/) and Turing Award winners (https://amturing.acm.org/). How do you want to contribute to the intersection of the two north stars to advance human civilizations? 

*2018 Turing Award Milestone*: LeCun, Yann, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton. "Deep learning." nature 521, no. 7553 (2015): 436-444.

Regarding the Turing Award, the winners I most admire are those from the year 2018. The 2018 laureates, Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yann LeCun, were honored specifically for their pioneering contributions to deep neural networks ( Association for Computing Machinery 2018). The deep neural networks are a product of an age characterized by increased computational power; their core logic involves the layering of massive numbers of simple computational units to form a 'black box' designed for feature extraction and prediction tasks (LeCun et al. 2018). This approach has significantly altered our application of machine learning, shifting from a prevalent reliance on supervised learning for making predictions, to allowing for the more stochastic processing of large datasets (LeCun et al. 2018). Consequently, deep neural networks have rapidly and intensely influenced numerous associated domains, including computer vision and natural language processing, among others (LeCun et al. 2018).
